<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Ubuntu;">Seventeen years can mean a lot of things, can be an electoral number, an metric of sexual organs, or only a number, or for me, an age, age which day 13th of July of 2024 i will have (and have) achieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> Everyone has a year in adolescence which they pass from being an edgy adolescent that doesn't care to anything and just want to see the world burn, to an almost young adult that understand how it works to have responsibilities and live life with them.

With 16 years i lost, made and remade a lot of friendships .At 16 years i almost killed myself sometimes and at the look of the kitchen knife i thinked the opposite. at 16 years i was the most idiot to give presents to people who didn't wanted me in their lives. At 16 years i was the most dumb solitary person that i ever knew, and at 16 years old i became someone i never thought of becoming.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I made a lot of mistakes, fell to the ground, demoralized myself, but also learned, learned a lot, discovered myself, got up and continued to live, continued to be someone better, continued to live my life which is my only obligation as an human being, it may look like im talking about the end of a journey, i have a lot to improve and a lot to achieve. The biggest gift that i've ever had was the possibility to live and see people supporting me to live, even it was to die tomorrow, i would still be happy even with my last words, because im grateful to achieve things that people wouldn't even imagine achieving in their lifetimes, and i praise to always continue.
